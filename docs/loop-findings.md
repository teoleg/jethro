# Loop findings — accumulating trade/change lessons (append-only memory)

Each improvement cycle appends **one** concise, dated finding here: what the window's **orders** and any
**change** did to total PnL and exposure, the **trigger** behind a bad (or good) move, and the **rule for
next time**. The loop reads the recent entries every cycle (situation triage) so lessons **compound**
instead of being relearned. Newest at the bottom. Keep each entry short and specific — this is memory, not
prose. Full per-cycle reasoning lives in `reports/last-analysis.md` and the ledger; this file is the
distilled, durable lessons.

Format per entry:
```
### <UTC timestamp> — <commit sha or "no-change">
- Situation: <PnL/exposure move this window, in $>.
- Cause: <which order trigger / change drove it — name the reason>.
- Lesson / rule: <what to do or avoid next time>.
```

When this grows past what fits in a prompt, it becomes the corpus for **RAG retrieval (ADR-0035)** — embed
each finding + trade outcome and retrieve the relevant ones per situation instead of reading all of them.

### 2026-07-26T16:45Z — ADR-0069 (hedge no-trade band)
- Situation: PnL -$866.49 (-$3.26 this window, -$843.66 over 3 runs), gross $6,885.14 / net $4,897.35, both
  flat. The 3-run loss is almost entirely the `fb9273505` round trip's spread+fee cost (185 fills, $130.90
  fees), already scored ❌ BAD and reverted — sunk, not an ongoing bleed. Last cycle's `c12099fea` traded
  nothing at all, so this window's move is 100% mark drift on untouched positions: **market, not change.**
- Cause: `$5,791` of the `$6,885` gross (84%) was a single ES hedge leg the advisor itself wanted at
  `$1,093`. Trigger: ADR-0039's `$10k` absolute min-trade guard. Once the hedged book shrank below the
  guard, *every* delta a small hedge can produce — including its own full unwind — fell under it, so the
  position was untradable in both directions and stranded permanently.
- Lesson / rule: **an absolute-dollar threshold that gates trading becomes an absolute barrier below its
  own scale — always express it relative to the thing it gates, and take the MIN of absolute and relative,
  never the max.** Same failure class as ADR-0068's risk dials. When a `holding`/`ON-TARGET` rationale
  cites a fixed dollar threshold, check it against the *current* book size, not the book it was written for.
- Rule 2: the ledger's PnL-per-$1-gross annotation is degenerate while PnL is negative — cutting unwanted
  exposure makes the ratio look worse. Judge de-risking on the vector (PnL flat, exposure down), not the ratio.
